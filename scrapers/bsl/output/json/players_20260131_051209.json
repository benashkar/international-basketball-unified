      "description": "Philip Alexander Scrubb (born 27 November 1992) is a Canadian professional basketball player for Petkim Spor of the Basketbol Süper Ligi (BSL).\r\n\r\nDuring his university basketball career, he won five CIS championships with the Carleton University Ravens, before embarking on a professional career. Scrubb is considered one of the greatest players in CIS basketball history.\r\n\r\nScrubb played high school basketball at Vancouver College, under the basketball coach Bill Disbrow.\r\n\r\nScrubb's career is perhaps the most accomplished in the history of Canadian Interuniversity Sport basketball. In 2010, Scrubb joined a powerhouse Carleton Ravens team at Carleton University that had won the Canadian men’s university basketball championship in six of the previous eight years. He averaged 13.1 points per game, and helped the Ravens to a perfect 22–0 record, and their seventh national championship. Scrubb was named an OUA East Second Team All-Star, and earned the Dr. Peter Mullins Trophy as CIS Rookie of the Year.\r\n\r\nIn his second season at Carleton, Scrubb led the Ravens to another 22–0 season, and earned the Mike Moser Memorial Trophy as the Outstanding Player in the CIS. He also was awarded the Jack Donohue Trophy as MVP of the CIS Championship Tournament, as the Ravens took the national title again.\r\n\r\nScrubb won his second Moser Trophy the following year, and took the award again after the 2013–14 season. He is the only three-time recipient of the award in CIS history. In his final season at Carleton, Scrubb led the Ravens to their fifth consecutive national title, and earned his second Donohue Trophy as playoff MVP. He also was selected First Team All-Canadian for the fourth consecutive year. During his five years at Carleton, the Ravens had a won-lost record of 102–3. He and his brother Thomas dominated CIS basketball during their time with the Ravens.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the season at Carleton, Scrubb signed with Entersport, a professional basketball agency. In July 2015, Scrubb played with the NBA Summer League teams of the Memphis Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors. In August 2015, Scrubb began his professional career with the Greek League club AEK Athens, after signing a two-year contract with them. In the winter of 2016, he moved to Germany, after he was loaned by AEK to the German Bundesliga club, the Skyliners Frankfurt. On 1 May 2016, he captured the FIBA Europe Cup title with the Skyliners, tallying six points, three rebounds and two assists in the championship game.\r\n\r\nThe Frankfurt team exercised an option in June 2016, to keep Scrubb for the 2016–17 season. However, he missed the beginning of the season, due to problems with his knee; and in December 2016, the Skyliners announced that Scrubb had to undergo surgery to repair the knee injury, after the failure of conservative treatment, and that he would be out for between six and nine months. He returned to the Frankfurt team for the 2017–18 season. In April 2018, Scrubb won the BBL Best Offensive Player award. Scrubb was the Basketball Bundesliga Top Scorer as well, as he averaged 18.3 points per game on his way to leading Frankfurt to the playoffs as the eighth-seed.\r\n\r\nOn 18 July 2018, Scrubb signed a one-year deal with Zenit Saint Petersburg of the VTB United League. On 17 July 2019, Scrubb signed a one-year deal with Spanish club Movistar Estudiantes. Scrubb averaged 9.4 points per game. On 23 July 2020, he signed with Limoges CSP of the LNB Pro A.\r\n\r\nOn 14 May 2021, Scrubb signed with the Niagara River Lions of the Canadian Elite Basketball League.\r\n\r\nOn 17 August 2021, Scrubb signed with the Russian team BC Avtodor of the VTB United League. he averaged 11.9 points, 2.0 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game. He left the team after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nOn 9 March 2022, Scrubb signed with Monbus Obradoiro of the Liga ACB.\r\n\r\nOn 13 April 2023, Scrubb re-signed with the Niagara River Lions, but didn't play for them. On 10 August, he signed with Bahçeşehir Koleji of the Basketbol Süper Ligi.\r\n\r\nIn August 2024, Scrubb returned to the Spanish league, signing with newly-promoted Leyma Coruña.\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 2025, he signed with Petkim Spor of the Basketbol Süper Ligi (BSL).\r\n\r\nScrubb represented Canada's national teams on the international stage several times: He helped Canada’s Under-18 junior national team win a bronze medal at the 2010 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship, and also played for Team Canada Under-19 at the 2011 FIBA Under-19 World Cup. The same year, he made Canada’s roster for the 2011 Pan American Games. Scrubb also played at the 2013 World University Games,\r\n\r\nIn 2015, Scrubb helped the senior men's Canadian national basketball team win the Marchand Cup, and capture bronze at the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship. He also played for senior Team Canada at the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Manila.\r\n\r\nScrubb is of British descent. His brother, Thomas, is also a professional basketball player.",

He played college basketball for the Keiser University Seahawks, where he was coached by Rollie Massimino.\r\n\r\nStanley Whittaker attended Frank Phillips College from 2013 to 2015, before transferring to Keiser University in West Palm Beach, Florida. He graduated in 2017. At Keiser, he played under head coach Rollie Massimino who died in August 2017. Whittaker was a two-time NAIA All-American.\r\n\r\nAfter his college education, Stanley Whittaker suffered several professional and personal setbacks. Whittaker couldn't find a job in basketball for two years. He kept in touch with his sport through training children.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, he had the first engagement with BC Jonava where he played a few games during the 2019–20 LKL season (Second Lithuanian league).\r\n\r\nFortunately for Whittaker, in January 2020, several players from UBSC Graz were involved in a betting scandal so Graz needed replacement players at short notice. Although Whittaker barely had time to settle in Austria, he scored over 18 points per game in his first season and averaged eight assists. He even improved this record in the 2020–21 Austrian Basketball Superliga with an average of over 21 points and eight assists. Besides being the league's best scorer, he also served as team captain for UBSC Graz.\r\n\r\nIn August 2021, he signed with PS Karlsruhe Lions of the German ProA. He scored over 22 points, got over 5 rebounds and made over 6 assists per game in 34 games for the PS Karlsruhe Lions.\r\n\r\nIn June 2022, he signed with s.Oliver Würzburg of the German Basketball Bundesliga. Whittaker wrapped-up the 2022–23 season as the team's leading scorer, averaging 18.0 points, while dishing out 5.1 assists per contest in Bundesliga play. On June 19, 2023, Dinamo Sassari of the Italian Lega Basket Serie A announced his signing.\r\n\r\nOn July 17, 2025, he signed with Petkim Spor of the Basketbol Süper Ligi (BSL).",
