He played college basketball for the Marquette Golden Eagles, where he was a two-time All-American and led the nation in scoring in the 2019–20 season.\r\n\r\nHoward began his high school career at Perry High School in Gilbert, Arizona. As a freshman, he started in the backcourt with his brother and averaged 23 points per game, leading his team to the state semifinals. He committed to Arizona State following his freshman season. After a sophomore season where he averaged 32.4 points per game, Howard decommitted from Arizona State and reopened up his recruitment.\r\n\r\nFor his junior season, Howard transferred to national basketball power Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nevada. During his junior season at Findlay Prep, where he led the team in scoring, Howard announced that he would reclassify to the class of 2016 and signed with Marquette.\r\n\r\nAs a freshman at Marquette University, Howard entered the starting lineup and averaged 13.2 points per game and led the country in three-point shooting at 54.7%. He was named to the 2017 Big East Conference All-Freshman team. As a sophomore, Howard became one of college basketball's top scorers. On the season, Howard averaged 20.4 points per game and was named second-team All-Big East. He also finished the season with the NCAA's second-best free throw percentage (93.8%).\r\n\r\nGoing into his junior season of 2018–19, Howard earned national preseason recognition, appearing on the watch lists for the Wooden Award, the Naismith Award and the Bob Cousy Award for top point guard. Howard was also selected preseason first-team All-Big East. In Marquette's non-conference schedule, Howard recorded two 45-point games, against ranked teams Kansas State and Buffalo. In the Buffalo win, Howard scored 40 of his total in the second half. He scored a career-high 53 points in an overtime win over Creighton on January 9, 2019, breaking a Big East single-game record.\r\n\r\nHoward became Marquette's all-time leading scorer when he contributed 38 points in an 88–53 victory against Loyola (Md.) in the team's season opener of his senior year. He was named Big East player of the week on November 11, 2019. On November 29, Howard scored 51 points in a 101–79 win over USC. He became the third player to score 50 points in a game in three straight seasons, joining Wayman Tisdale and Pete Maravich. In addition, since he scored 40 points in the previous match, he joined Maravich, Johnny Neumann, and Bob Pettit as the only players in major conferences to score 40 points on back-to-back days. Howard sat out a game against Jacksonville on December 4 with a concussion. On February 12, 2020, Howard scored 24 points and had five rebounds and two assists in a 72–71 loss to Villanova. He became the Big East's all-time leading scorer in league games, surpassing Lawrence Moten's 1,405 points. At the conclusion of the regular season, Howard was unanimously selected to the First Team All-Big East. Howard averaged 27.8 points and 3.3 assists per game as a senior. During his time at Marquette University, Howard accumulated 2761 points.\r\n\r\nHoward has represented the United States in FIBA play on two occasions.

Seeing his potential, Ton persuaded Parkhouski to first attend a junior college in the United States before enrolling at a major university to progress in basketball and to simultaneously learn English. At College of Southern Idaho, Parakhouski struggled to grasp the language, admitting \"It was hard for me. The first five-to-six months I couldn't speak at all. I couldn't understand anyone around me. I was basically in a jungle with nobody.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Ton became an assistant coach at Radford University, Parakhouski followed him. Under the guidance of head coach Brad Greenberg he developed into a National Basketball Association (NBA) center prospect following his 2009–10 senior season but was ultimately never drafted.\r\n\r\nCollege career\r\nParakhouski spent his first two seasons of his NCAA eligibility at College of Southern Idaho, where in 63 games played he averaged 10.1 points and 6.4 rebounds on 60.1% shooting. Parakhouski then spent his final two college seasons as a Radford Highlander.\r\n\r\nAs a junior in 2008–09, Parakhouski averaged 16.2 points, 11.2 rebounds and 1.5 blocks on 53.7% shooting. He led Radford to win the Big South Conference Tournament by scoring 26 points and grabbing 18 rebounds in the championship game. After gaining an automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament as the 16th seed, he then scored 10 points and grabbed 10 rebounds against the #1-seed and eventual national champion North Carolina Tar Heels and former National Player of the Year Tyler Hansbrough. In March 2009 he was named the Big South Player of the Year.\r\n\r\nParakhouski repeated as the conference player of the year his senior season in 2009–10. He averaged 13.4 rebounds in 31 games played, which led the nation in rebounds per game. He also scored 21.4 points and block 2.1 shots per game. Parakhouski ended his two-year career at Radford having scored 1,195 points, grabbed 783 rebounds and blocked 115 shots. He was the two-time conference player of the year and was also a two-time First Team All Big South selection.\r\n\r\nProfessional career\r\nParakhouski did not get selected in the 2010 NBA draft; however, he played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010 Orlando Pro Summer League. On August 20, 2010, he signed with Latvian club BK VEF Rīga and won the Latvian Basketball League championship.\r\n\r\nOn June 24, 2014, he signed a two-year deal with the Russian team Nizhny Novgorod. In 2014–15 season, Nizhny Novgorod ended the competition in the VTB United League after being eliminated by CSKA Moscow with 3–0 in the semifinal series.\r\n\r\nOn July 5, 2015, he signed a one-year contract with the option of another year with UNICS. On March 27, 2017, Parakhouski recorded a double-double with a career-high 30 points and 10 rebounds, shooting 15-of-17 from the field, in a 95–83 win over Avtodor Saratov.\r\n\r\nOn August 27, 2017, he signed a 1+1 year deal with the Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv. On January 5, 2018, Parakhouski recorded a season-high 16 points, shooting 7-of-10 from the field, along with eight rebounds and two steals in an 81–93 loss to Real Madrid. Parakhouski won the 2017 Israeli League Cup and the 2018 Israeli League Championship titles with Maccabi.\r\n\r\nOn December 19, 2018, he signed with Rytas Vilnius of the Lithuanian Basketball League for the rest of the season. On February 17, 2019, Parakhouski won the 2019 King Mindaugas Cup Finals after scoring 14 points in a 70-67 win over Žalgiris. He was subsequently named the King Mindaugas Cup MVP.\r\n\r\nOn August 7, 2019, he signed with Partizan NIS Belgrade of the Basketball League of Serbia and EuroCup. On November 20, 2019, he parted ways with Partizan after appearing in 12 games.\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 2020, he signed with SIG Strasbourg of the French LNB Pro A for the rest of the season.\r\n\r\nOn December 30, 2020, he has signed with Andorra of the Liga ACB.",

He played college basketball for the Iowa State Cyclones before starting his professional career in Europe, then moving to the National Basketball Association (NBA), and back to Europe again.\r\n\r\nMatt Thomas was born in Decatur, Illinois. He grew up in Onalaska, Wisconsin, attending Onalaska High School. His mother had been a standout high school athlete herself. He was a swimmer, softball player, tennis player, and basketball star. He holds the school record for single game scoring at Wahlert High School in Dubuque, Iowa, with 48 points.\r\n\r\nThomas suffered tragedy at a young age. When he was 9 years old, his father, Greg, who suffered from alcoholism, died of suicide. Because of this Thomas developed a very strong relationship with his mother.\r\n\r\nThomas was an outstanding high school basketball player. He was named first-team all-state by the Associated Press as a junior in 2012. He averaged 21.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 2.1 steals in 2012 to lead his team to the Division 2 state championship. Onalaska ended the year with a 27–1 record. Thomas scored 30 points in the state championship game, a 55–38 victory over Kaukauna. His senior year Thomas averaged 28.3 points and 9.7 rebounds, leading his team to the state semifinals and a 24–3 mark, shooting 50.4% percent from the field and 35.8% from beyond the arc. Thomas scored more than 40 points three times, including 41 points in the sectional final and a career-high 50 points in just 2 1/2 quarters vs. Tomah. He participated in the 2013 American Family Insurance High School 3-Point Championship, finishing third. Thomas ended his four-year career as a two-time first-team all-state pick with a 95–12 overall mark and over 2,000 points.\r\n\r\nAn outstanding scorer, Thomas was considered one of the best shooters in the class of 2013 and one of the best players from Wisconsin. A consensus top-100 national recruit, Thomas was ranked No. 51 by ESPN, No. 54 by Rivals.com, and No. 58 by Scout.com in the final national rankings. Being highly sought after Thomas eventually chose Iowa State over Virginia, Minnesota, Boston College and Marquette.",

He was drafted 59th overall by the San Antonio Spurs in the 2011 NBA draft. Hanga won the EuroLeague Best Defender award in 2017.\r\n\r\nHanga was born to a Hungarian mother and a Zanzibari Tanzanian father, who was studying in Hungary at that time. His father left the family when Ádám was 3 years old and he was brought up by his mother and maternal grandparents.\r\n\r\nHe is the nephew of African-Russian journalist and television personality Yelena Khanga.\r\n\r\nHanga began his career with the Hungarian club, Albacomp, in 2006, at the age of 17, and stayed with the Székesfehérvár-based club until 2011. In June 2009, he was invited to the Adidas Eurocamp, an event that is held annually in Treviso, for top-flight players, aged between 18 and 21. After three days of training and scrimmages, he was ranked the sixth best non-U.S. player in his age group. The 2010–11 season turned out to be his breakout year, as he dominated the Hungarian League.\r\n\r\nIn May 2011, he moved to the Spanish League, signing with Bàsquet Manresa. The San Antonio Spurs selected Hanga with the 59th pick in the 2011 NBA draft.\r\n\r\nIn July 2013, Hanga signed a four-year deal with the Spanish club Baskonia. In August 2014, he was loaned to the Italian League team Sidigas Avellino, for the 2014–15 season. Hanga came back to Baskonia Vitoria-Gasteiz on 11 May 2015 for the final games of the 2014–15 ACB season, after finishing the Lega Basket season with Avellino. On 28 June 2017 Hanga was registered by Baskonia for the right of first refusal. On 9 July 2017 Hanga signed an offer sheet with FC Barcelona Lassa. On 12 July 2017 Baskonia matched the offer sheet to Hanga, keeping Hanga in their roster. On 23 July 2017 Hanga re-signed with Baskonia, through the 2019–20 season.\r\n\r\nOn 22 August 2017 Baskonia and FC Barcelona reached an agreement for the transfer of Hanga to the Catalan club. On 9 July 2019 Barcelona Bàsquet announced Hanga had extended his contract with the club until 2022, with an option to continue through 2023. On 16 July 2021 Hanga parted ways with the club after four seasons together.\r\n\r\nOn 23 July 2021 Hanga signed a two-year deal with Liga ACB archrivals Real Madrid. On 24 June 2023 Real Madrid informed the player that they would not pick up his contract option and he would become a free agent.\r\n\r\nOn 12 July 2023 Hanga signed a two-year contract with Crvena zvezda.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 2024, he signed with Joventut Badalona of the Spanish Liga ACB.",

The Timberwolves had an agreement in principle with his Spanish team, DKV Joventut, to buy out his contract, but Rubio backed out of the deal. On 31 August 2009, Joventut traded the rights to Rubio to FC Barcelona, and Rubio signed a six-year contract with FC Barcelona the following day. In 2011, Rubio joined the Timberwolves, and spent six seasons in Minnesota before being traded to the Utah Jazz in June 2017. He signed with the Phoenix Suns in July 2019, before returning to Minnesota in 2020. Rubio was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in August 2021, but was dealt to the Indiana Pacers a month after suffering a season ending ACL injury in December.\r\n\r\nIn August 2023, Rubio announced he was taking a break from the sport to prioritise his mental health. In January 2024, he announced that he would be retiring from the NBA.",
