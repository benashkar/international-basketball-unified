He attended Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nevada before spending two seasons playing college basketball for the Ohio State University.\r\n\r\nHigh school career\r\nWanting to develop his basketball in a different way, he moved to the United States in 2011, to Findlay Prep high school in Henderson, Nevada. There, he was a starter in their National High School Invitational victory in 2012, breaking the school record for three-pointers in a season, with 66.\r\n\r\nCollege career\r\nThis caught the eye of several colleges and, after graduating, he signed a letter of intent to play for Ohio State in the Big Ten Conference of the NCAA Division I, choosing them over scholarship offers from Arizona and Texas A&M. The only player recruited that year by Ohio State, Amedeo took some time to adapt to the rigours of college basketball, especially the physical side having never done weights in the past, he was exclusively used as a bench player in his freshman season. Having put on weight for his sophomore season he started earning more game time although he stayed a bench option, he notably was decisive in overturning an 18-point, second-half deficit to beat Nebraska in the quarter-finals of the Big Ten Tournament in what is regarded as his best game for the team. After Ohio State's elimination in the first round of the NCAA Division I Tournament against Dayton he announced his intention to return to Italy to play professional basketball.",
