      "description": "Aubrey Lafell Dawkins (born May 8, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for Würzburg Baskets of the Basketball Bundesliga. He played college basketball for the UCF Knights, transferring to UCF after completing his sophomore season for the 2015–16 Michigan Wolverines. He is the son of Johnny Dawkins who became the UCF coach following the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.\r\n\r\nDawkins was raised in North Carolina until spending his high school years in Northern California at St. Francis High School and Palo Alto High School and a postgraduate year in New England at New Hampton Prep. As a collegiate freshman for the 2014–15 Wolverines, he began the season on the bench, but became a starter when injuries plagued the team in January 2015. In his more prominent role later in the season, Dawkins led the 2014–15 Big Ten Conference in effective field goal percentage and true shooting percentage during conference play."
